# Next Express JWT CRUD Products

This is a CRUD products with APIs and NextJs. 

# Getting Started

Clone this repository

    git clone https://github.com/yusufginanjar/next-express-jwt-crud-products.git

Run Frontend and Backend in different terminal

## Backend

Before running this application, make sure you set database config in Backend/config/config.json
In my case, I use MySQL with database win. So you can open config.json and set the database as your local configuration.

    cd Backend
    npm run dev

It runs on http://localhost:4000/

Frontend
    
    cd Frontend
    npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000/
